# 2022 C++ Core
This is the core robot code for FRC Team 2165, for the 2022 game RAPID REACTâ„¢.

If you're here from outside of Team 2165, welcome! Have fun navigating the code and seeing how our robot worked!

Please don't open any issues if you think something is wrong with the code. If you do, they will be closed immediately, without comment. 
After 2022, this will likely only ever be used as reference.
